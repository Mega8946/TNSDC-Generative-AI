The natural language processing (NLP) project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis system to automatically classify customer feedback into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The project involves several stages, including data collection from various sources such as customer reviews and social media, preprocessing of text data to remove noise and standardize formats, and model development using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The trained sentiment analysis model will then be deployed to analyze incoming feedback in real-time, providing businesses with valuable insights into customer sentiment and enabling them to make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Throughout the project, emphasis will be placed on accuracy, scalability, and usability to ensure effective integration into existing business processes.
